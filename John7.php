            <h2 id="g" >John 7</h2>  
            <p>
                1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
                <br>
                <br>
                2 Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
                <br>
                <br>
                3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
                <br>
                <br>
                4 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.
                <br>
                <br>
                6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
                <br>
                <br>
                7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
                <br>
                <br>
                8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
                <br>
                <br>
                9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
                <br>
                <br>
                10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
                <br>
                <br>
                11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
                <br>
                <br>
                12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
                <br>
                <br>
                13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
                <br>
                <br>
                14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
                <br>
                <br>
                15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
                <br>
                <br>
                16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
                <br>
                <br>
                17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
                <br>
                <br>
                18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
                <br>
                <br>
                19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
                <br>
                <br>
                20 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
                <br>
                <br>
                21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
                <br>
                <br>
                22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
                <br>
                <br>
                23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
                <br>
                <br>
                24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
                <br>
                <br>
                25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
                <br>
                <br>
                26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
                <br>
                <br>
                27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
                <br>
                <br>
                28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
                <br>
                <br>
                29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
                <br>
                <br>
                30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
                <br>
                <br>
                31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
                <br>
                <br>
                32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
                <br>
                <br>
                33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
                <br>
                <br>
                34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.
                <br>
                <br>
                35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
                <br>
                <br>
                36 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?
                <br>
                <br>
                37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
                <br>
                <br>
                38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
                <br>
                <br>
                39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
                <br>
                <br>
                40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
                <br>
                <br>
                41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
                <br>
                <br>
                42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
                <br>
                <br>
                43 So there was a division among the people because of him.
                <br>
                <br>
                44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
                <br>
                <br>
                45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
                <br>
                <br>
                46 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
                <br>
                <br>
                47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
                <br>
                <br>
                48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
                <br>
                <br>
                49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
                <br>
                <br>
                50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
                <br>
                <br>
                51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
                <br>
                <br>
                52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
                <br>
                <br>
                53 And every man went unto his own house.
